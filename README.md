# The Vagrantfile Repository
This is just a repo for storing various Vagrantfiles that have specific use cases. I may update this repository from time to time.

To briefly list what each of these does:
* homebrew-dev: Sets up a development environment for a variety of game consoles, including the 3DS, GBA, and Wii.
* ...and that's kind of it for now
